# The 1-2 transformation

This folder contains the structures and PM6 energies of the ligand transformation MeBz to Bz bound to an octa-acid host in the folders `prot` and in solution in the folders `wat`.

The MeBz ligand (stored in a folder `V0`) is extracted from `lambda=0.00` (stored in the folder `000`).
Similarly, the Bz ligand (stored in a folder `V1`) is extracted for `lambda=1.00` (stored in the folder `100`).
